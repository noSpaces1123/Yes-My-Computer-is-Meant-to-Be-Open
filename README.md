# Yes, My Computer is Meant to Be Open
Ever wanted to go out to get dinner or something and wanted to keep your computer on to update a cool Steam game but worry about someone at home seeing your computer is on and mistakenly turning it off for you against your will?

Ever wanted to know if your parents or partner has gone through your computer without relying on their honesty of which can be so, so stupidly easy to fake?

Worry no more.

YMCMBO (Yes, My Computer is Meant to Be Open) fixes this problem in the simplest way possible. YMCMBO will also display the last time YMCMBO has been interacted with (including keypresses, mouse movements, and focusing or unfocusing YMCMBO) and will display the last time YMCMBO was opened, so that nosy peepers can't look through your computer and close and reopen YMCMBO to erase the forgotten interaction without you sussing them out!
